## Compatibility

This mod has incompatibilities, I tested it with two mods:

Extended Clouds - does not run with Cull Clouds

SuperFancyClouds - runs, but Cull Clouds does nothing

The list of incompatibilities may grow, because in order to improve the vanilla clouds, Cull Clouds is essentially rewriting it

## Performance

Here's a comparison of fps between Vanilla and Cull Clouds

**If you're not playing on a flat world, the increase may be very small, something like a 1-2 fps difference**
